# Paw & Home - Inventory System

**Project:** Inventory management for a pet store  
**Technologies:** React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js  
**Context:** University project in the *Fábrica Escuela* section; web development practice in a collaborative environment.  

## Description

Paw & Home is a web application designed to manage the inventory of a pet store. It allows tracking of available products, quantities, and makes it easy to visualize best-selling and least-selling items.  

For this project, I was responsible for the **frontend**, building the user interface with React and Tailwind CSS.  

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Additional Tools:** Node.js Snippets, Tailwind Snippets  
- **Package Manager:** npm  
- **Design and Prototyping:** Figma, V0  

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/Agiras2/Paw-Home---Inventory-System.git`  
   `cd Paw-Home---Inventory-System`

2. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   If you don't have them installed, download and install from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install project dependencies:**  
   `npm install`

4. **Install Tailwind CSS and Node.js Snippets (optional, recommended for development):**  
   - Tailwind CSS Snippets: VSCode extension to simplify Tailwind classes and utilities.  
   - Node.js Snippets: VSCode extension to speed up Node.js development.

5. **Start the application:**  
   `npm start`  
   This will run the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** React and Tailwind code
- **Backend:** Node.js server and inventory logic
- **Public:** Public resources (images, icons, etc.)


## Design and Prototyping

- **Figma:** Used for creating UI/UX designs, wireframes, and mockups. [View Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/VWADrXFc7WcuMdc7WswGmF/PetManager--Inventory-Management?node-id=0-1&t=eTazxDPPeRIPH4MV-1)  
- **V0:** Used to implement design prototypes and layouts before final frontend development.
